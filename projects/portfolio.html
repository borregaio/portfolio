                Description
            </h4>

            <p>
                This fashion editorials gallery is a simple way to display my past work as a fashion stylist in 2011.  

                It was very difficult to find a simple portfolio website that would display images in a stylish and
                clean way for free, so I decided to create my own. 

                This Node app uses EJS to create templates for each photoshoot, simplifying the code a lot and make it
                very easy to expand in case more sections should be added. 

                The CSS animations give it a nice touch when hovering the thumbnail, where you can see the title
                display. 

                This website is mobile-friendly. 
            </p>

                Lessons learned
            </h4>

            <p>
                I started with HTML and then switched to EJS later on. Creating a Node app helped me to reduce the
                amount of coding used. I just needed one “app.js” file to create multiple “app.get” routes for each
                photoshoot, instead of the multiple HTML pages needed otherwise. 
            </p>

            <h4 class="project-title">
                Next steps
            </h4>

            <p>
                In case this project had to be expanded into a portfolio, more sections would be added with more
                information about the stylist, explanation about the different photoshoots and contact information
                pages.
