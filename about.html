            <p>
                I am a full-stack web developer who loves learning and improving everyday.
            </p>
            <p>
                I changed careers in 2021 to pursue web development and it is one of the best decisions I’ve ever made.
                I am a self-taught programmer, which can be hard at times, but I consider myself an enthusiastic and
                hard-working person who loves a challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've had experience as a manager and visual merchandiser in the retail sector and have also worked
                within big tems. Now, as a
                full-stack web developer, I feel the excitement of working in an ever-changing industry that keeps
                growing
                everyday,
                with all the opportunities that might bring to my career.
            </p>
            <p>
                So far, my set of skills is composed of HTML, CSS, EJS, JavaScript, Node and MongoDB. I'm also
                currently learning React. You can check a selection of my projects <span class="projects-link"
                    onclick="location='/projects.html'">here</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m a team player, I adapt to change quickly and I'm enthusiastic to keep learning new skills and coding
                languages. My goal is to be part of a team where we can code amazing stuff and make a difference!
